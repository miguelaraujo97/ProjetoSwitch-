# US033 - As SM/Team Member, I want to register work done on a Task




## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As SM/Team Member, I want to register work done on a Task


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 
+ Question:
>Consiste em registar o esforço gasto numa dada tarefa, sendo que a soma destes registos representa o effort spent da tarefa?*

+ Answer:
>Consiste em registar esforço gasto numa dada tarefa. 27/01/2022

+ Question:
>As SM/Team Member, I want to register work done on a Task:*
é suposto as tasks terem um ou vários logs associados para registarmos o trabalho ? Ou simplesmente incrementar o atributo "hours spent"?

+ Answer:
>A forma como definirem as tasks vai condicionar o report de atividade. Se um tarefa tiver um e um só recurso associado, o processo é simplificado.
Também não me choca que o esforço de uma task seja atualizado em vez de manter vários registos. Ainda que vários registos podem ser interessantes em alguns cenários. 27/01/2022

+ Question:
>As SM/Team Member, I want to register work done on a Task:
>Quando o SM/ Team Member querem registar o trabalho feito numa tarefa , regista-se apenas as horas despendidas , ou também registar/adicionar comentários?

+ Answer:
>Pode fazer sentido registar comentários. 31/01/2022

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

The work done in a  sprint task and user story task can only be registered in currently active sprint.
The total hours spent in a task cannot be higher than the task effort.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

US017 - As Authenticated User, I want to get a list of all projects I'm currently allocated to.
US019 - As Team Member, I want to estimate the effort of a user story.
US023 - As Team Member, I want to add a user story in the product backlog to the sprint backlog.
US031 - As Team Member, I want to create a task in a user story
US032 - As SM/Team Member, I want to create task outside the scope of a user story

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

Input data:
 + Project code: String 
 + User story ID : int
 + Task ID: int 
 + Hours spent : int

Output data: True.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
|  Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor?	| SmTmWantRegisterWorkDoneInTaskUI | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
|  Step 2	     | ...coordinating the US? | SmTmWantRegisterWorkDoneInTaskController | Responsible to responding to an input event in the system generated by the User Interface |
|  Step 3	     | ...knowing all data from domain layer? | DataManagement | Responsible of knowing all the data in the Domain Layer |
|  Step 4	     | ...knowing all Projects? | ProjectStore | Knows all the projects |
|  Step 5	     | ...knowing all Sprints? | Project | Responsible of knowing all the Sprints in a Project|
|  Step 6		 | ...knows all Sprint task's? | Sprint | Contains all the tasks from a Sprint. |
|  Step 7	     | ...knowing all User Stories from the Sprint? | SprintBacklog | Knows all the UserStories from the Sprint |
|  Step 8	     | ...knows all User Story task´s | User Story | Contains all the tasks from a User Story |
|  Step 9        | ...register work done in a task | Task | Knows the work done and hours spent in a task


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

+ Project
+ Sprint
+ SprintBackLog
+ UserStory
+ Task

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * SmTmWantRegisterWorkDoneInTaskUI 
 * SmTmWantRegisterWorkDoneInTaskController
 * ProjectStore
 * DataManagement

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with empty values. 

    class ExampleFixture : public ::testing::Test {
        TEST_F(ExampleFixture, CreateWithEmptyCode){
            EXPECT_THROW(new Example(L"",L"Example One"),std::invalid_argument);
        }
    }
	

*It is also recommended organizing this content by subsections.* 


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
