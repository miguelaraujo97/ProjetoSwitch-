# US 019

> As TeamMember, I want to estimate the effort of a user story.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

[//]: # (*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*)

### 1.1. User Story Description

> As a Team member it's asked to set an estimated effort to a user story

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> Effort estimate (start by having the initial estimate, but can be updated several times throughout the projectDeprecated; uses Fibonacci series for duration in hours.)

**From the client clarifications:**

* Question

> Deve a effort estimate ser guardada ao nível da task ou ao nível da User Story? Caso seja ao nível da UserStory, é necessário distribuir essa estimativa pelas tasks? Se sim, de que forma? O que é que acontece se já existir uma estimativa de esforço registada? (Marta Silveira)

* Answer

> O Scrum (mais uma vez realço a importância de lerem o Scrum Guide) tem a cerimónia Scrum Planning. Nessa altura não há tarefas, mas apenas user stories no Product Backlog. A escolha de US para o sprint tem por base uma estimativa de esforço. Nada impede que o esforço das tasks necessárias para implementar essa US seja diferente.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

*Not specified*

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

> * Class Sprint;
>* Class SprintBackLog;
>* Class UserStory.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

> * Input:<p>
    > Fibonacci sequence for effort;

> * Output: <p>
    > True for added to a userStory.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

> The actor gets the user story of a existing sprint and associate the effort estimate

data.**

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 



 * Project

 * Sprint

 * SprintBacklog

 * UserStory



Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* DataManagement
* ProjectStore
* TeamMemberUI
* TeamMemberController

# 4. Tests

*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 



**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**



**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to associate an effort not listed. 



        void effortNotSet() {

        //Arrange
        UserStory newUS = new UserStory(description, priority, userStoryId);
        String description = "25 character or plus bla bla";
        int effort = 4;
        int priority = 1;
        int userStoryId = 1;

        //Act
        newUS.setEffort(effort);
        int expected = effort;
        int actual = newUS.getEffort();

        //Assert
        assertNotEquals(expected, actual);
    }







# 5. Construction (Implementation)

[//]: # (*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant &#40;e.g. configuration&#41; files and highlight relevant commits.*)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* )

# 6. Integration and Demo

[//]: # (*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*)

# 7. Observations

 It was created a classe Enum for the userStory in order to be made independent and possibility the utilization with other classes. For implementation of the enum it will be created a inferface class.
