## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor?	| AuthenticatedUserProjectsAllocatedUI | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
| Step 2	 | ...coordinating the US? | AuthenticatedUserProjectsAllocatedController | Responsible to responding to an input event in the system generated by the User Interface |
| Step 3	 | ...Knowing all the data from the domain layer? | DataManagement | Responsible of knowing all the data in the Domain Layer |
| Step 4	 | ...knows all Resources | ResourceStore | contains all the resources. |
| Step 5	 | ...create a copy list of projects the user is allocated  | ResourceStore | Knows all the resources that are allocated in a projectDeprecated.  |
| Step 6     | ... showing list of projects the user is allocated | AuthenticatedUserProjectsAllocatedUI | 


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

+ User
+ Resource


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * AuthenticatedUserProjectsAllocatedUI
 * AuthenticatedUserProjectsAllocatedControllerr
 *ResourceStore

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with empty values. 

    class ExampleFixture : public ::testing::Test {
        TEST_F(ExampleFixture, CreateWithEmptyCode){
            EXPECT_THROW(new Example(L"",L"Example One"),std::invalid_argument);
        }
    }
	

*It is also recommended organizing this content by subsections.* 


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
