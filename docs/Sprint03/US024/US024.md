### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...                               | Answer     | Justification (with patterns)      |
|:-------------  |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:-----------------------------------|
| Step 1  		 | 		Return the users list				                                               | UserStore  | Information expert                 |
| Step 2  		 | 						Return the user account and status list that is shown to the actor  | UserMapper | Pure fabrication and information expert |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * User

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * GetListUI  
 * GetUserAccountAndStatusListController
 * DataManagement
 * UserMapper
 * UserDTO
 * UserStore

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with empty values. 

    class ExampleFixture : public ::testing::Test {
        TEST_F(ExampleFixture, CreateWithEmptyCode){
            EXPECT_THROW(new Example(L"",L"Example One"),std::invalid_argument);
        }
    }
	

*It is also recommended organizing this content by subsections.* 


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
